# What it's supposed to be:

* Write down all the positive things that happend to you during the day or rather you did well.

* This is supposed to act as a daily reminder to be positive and be aware of good things happening, even the smallest things.

* This is meant to shift your focus to good things and keep/make you happy and thankful.

* Especially if you don't feel good, you can have a look back into the recent past. 

# Supposed to be implemented:

* Notes are supposed to be stored in the browser-local-storage.

* There should be a minimum of 3-5 daily notes before the form can be submitted.

* There should be some sort of view - to have an overview of the past weeks.

* There should be a random reminder of some past notes every once in a while.

* Little effects and animations should be included in the general UI.
