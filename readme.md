# What it's supposed to be:

* Write down all the positive things that happend to you during the day OR you did well OR you are thankful for.

* This is supposed to act as a daily reminder to be positive and be aware of good things happening, even the smallest things.

* This is meant to shift your focus to good things and keep/make you happy and thankful.

* You can have a look back into the recent past of your emotions and well-dones. 

# Supposed to be implemented:

* Notes are supposed to be stored in the browser-local-storage.

* There should be a minimum of 3-5 daily notes before the form can be submitted.

* There should be some sort of view - to have an overview of the past weeks - combined with the ls-database.

* Little effects and animations should be included in the general UI.

# Possible future implementations:

* Change name to a more appropriate one like "Dankbarkeitsritual" or "daily-app"

* There should be a random reminder of some past notes every once in a while.
